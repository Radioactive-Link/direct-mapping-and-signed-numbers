# Assignment 2: Advanced Data Representation

Mapping between number systems and signed number representations using C.

## Prerequisites

Ensure that you have gcc installed. My preferred method is via [chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/install#individual).

```powershell
choco install mingw
```

> Note: I am using a windows system for building and running, so these instructions make no guarantee for other systems.

## Building

Build the application with:

```powershell
gcc convert.c main.c -o convert
```

## Running

Run the application from the binary produced in the previous step.

```powershell
./convert
```
